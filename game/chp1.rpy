    "The war came silently. Without a noise. \nBut the damage it left was insurmountable."
    "Our once prosperous quadrant, Caedara, was left burning. Our people are being forced to leave the only home they\’ve known their whole lives."
    "There\’s an announcement on the news, Aurelios has taken down another Caedara\’s Regiment, and that\’s put immense pressure on the entire military base."
    "Aurelios this, Aurelios that. All anyone these days hears about is Aurelios, it\’s like they want us coming generations to remember who exactly we denied power by not surrendering."
    "The war started over Trionium— a powerful element capable of leveling entire zones."
    "They came with trade propositions first. Then threats. Then, rained beams on us when Caedara refused to fold, refused to let Trionium fall in the wrong hands."
    "Aurelios took it upon themselves to personally teach us a lesson."
    "And lesson they taught."
